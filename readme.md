This is a place where I jot down notes using my outliner to save stuff in GitHub. 

I'm not sure why saving stuff to GitHub is a good idea. But it has a host of features no other writing environment has. Maybe some of that will prove useful?

For me, the first step in such an exploration is to make it as easy for me to write on GitHub as it is in any other enivornment I write for. Here's a list of them..

1. My blog.

2. Facebook.

3. Twitter.

4. Email.

5. Messages.

6. ??

This is my first GitHub note! :-)
