I don't like the idea of toxic people. I've never heard it defined, and without a definition, it's nonsense. I know what the word <i>toxic</i> means. And the idea of a person being that, well, that's objectification. People can't be toxic. So if you say a person is toxic, you're really saying it isn't a person. And that's ugly.
